# Open Source Map Styles
OpenMapTiles comes with a variety of different styles optimized for the [OpenMapTiles vector tile schema](https://openmaptiles.org/schema). The styles and schema are free and open-source and you can adapt the design and code for your project or commercial product however you like, if you keep the copyright attributtion. You can either use the styles directly as basemap or as starting point for your own map style.

# GL Styles
Our map styles are written in the [Mapbox GL style specification](https://openmaptiles.org/docs/style/mapbox-gl-style-spec) and you can [edit them using Maputnik](https://openmaptiles.org/docs/style/maputnik).
The same style can be used in client based maps with [MapLibre GL JS](https://openmaptiles.org/docs/website/maplibre-gl-js/) or [OpenLayers](https://openmaptiles.org/docs/website/openlayers/), on native [Android/iOS mobile apps](https://openmaptiles.org/mobile/), and in raster maps for print and older clients like Leaflet thanks to [Tileserver GL](https://openmaptiles.org/docs/host/tileserver-gl/).
